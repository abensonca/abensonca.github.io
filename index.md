I am a Staff Scientist at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science. My research program is focused on
understanding the nature of dark matter and the process of galaxy formation, with a particular emphasis on formlating a coherent
picture of the many different aspects of these problems. I have developed a model of dark matter and galaxy formation physics,
[_Galacticus_](https://github.com/galacticusorg/galacticus/wiki), which is available to the community as an open source
project. The approach blends both analytic understanding and significant number-crunching utilizing in-house and external compute
clusters.

## Dark Matter

### Constraining the Particle Mass of Warm Dark Matter

A model realization of the gravitational lensing convergence 
field around the observed gravitational quad-lens system WFI 2033-4723. Tens of 
millions of such realizations were generated to quantify how frequently 
different types of dark matter would produce gravitational lensing 
magnifications similar to those observed. From [Gilman, AJB, et al. (2020, 
MNRAS, 491, 6077)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.6077G/abstract).
